        <img src="ramnagar lassi.jpg" alt="Ramnagar lassi ">
        <p>A respite for motorists in the hot sun, and a fancy place for the tourists to try something native of the locality, Shiv Prasad Lassi Bhandar is a charmer of sorts. With a backdrop of the mounting Fort that proves contrasting to its unassuming manner, this place serves delicious Lassi (sweet curd topped with thickened cream). A highly popular destination in the city, they serve the lassi in small earthen pots, which undoubtedly provides a cooling effect. There are wooden benches in the outdoor setting, but most of the customers are seen standing in a huddle while relishing.</p>
